# AndroidHitRateCalc
An EXTREMELY basic translation of my iOS app. Jetpack Compose is declaritive like SwiftUI, so I used ChatGPT to help translate some of the code from Swift to Kotlin. Full disclosure, I didn't put much effort into this but maybe someone else can spruce up the design?

## Architecture
What architecture? Everything is in a single file. Not there's much code to begin with.
